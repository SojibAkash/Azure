# Microsoft Azure

### Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide variety of services that we can use without purchasing and arranging our hardware.

## Azure Services like compute, storage, network, and application services allow us to put our effort into building great solutions without worrying about the assembly of physical infrastructure.

## It helps the organizations in building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.
