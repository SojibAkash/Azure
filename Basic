Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide variety of services that we can use without purchasing and arranging our hardware.

Azure Services like compute, storage, network, and application services allow us to put our effort into building great solutions without worrying about the assembly of physical infrastructure.

It helps the organizations in building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.
